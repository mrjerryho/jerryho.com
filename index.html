								<h4>My Photography</h4>
							</a>
							<p class="mb-0 text-white-50">
								Photography is a complex field that heavily relies on programming.
								With the advancements in technology,
								hand-held cameras now boast sensors that can capture millions of pixels,
								creating images that can be transformed through image manipulation and analysis.
								Although I am still exploring the realm of machine learning and AI in image processing,
								I also enjoy pursuing my passion for photography as a freelance portrait photographer.
								Feel free to read my glowing reviews on Thumbtack and see my work for yourself.

									Back in 2019, I interviewed Jerry and made a recommendation to hire him on our scrum team at Disney Entertainment (formerly DTCI/DMED) to assist with development and support all of our in house digital asset management and transfer tools (AMP, Jellyroll, Agile Media Network, Media Monorail etc). I was determined to build a high performing team of only A+ players and Jerry made the cut among several other candidates. Jerry is a fast thinking fast acting and very hard working developer. I can vouch for him and recommend him and his relentless work ethic as a real asset to any software development team.

									I have worked on the same team as Jerry for about a year, and working with him has been a pleasure. Jerry is a great developer who is always willing to collaborate on work or just lend a helping hand. He has never backed away from challenging work, and he makes himself available to jump in when extra help is needed, both on dev and with ops.
									<br/><br/>
									Jerry is a valuable asset to any team as I have seen with his work on ops and on my own team. He is always smiling, making jokes, and makes the work environment better just by being his happy self!

									Jerry is a textbook example of a great hire. He was originally an intern that worked on our operations team while he was in school and now he's a solid full stack engineer on the application team. Jerry has proven that he can develop new features on his own or in teams and can also find his way around a 7 year old monolith to fix bugs. Also even though he's not on the ops team any more he's willing to jump back in and help with deployments or other operations tasks if we need him.
									<br/><br/>
									Jerry is one of the kindest and most fun people on the team, having spent time with him in the office and outside of it. Jerry also always shares his lunches which are both unique and delicious.

									Having attended the same university and having worked at Springbot together with Jerry, I cannot recommend Jerry enough. Jerry is extremely driven, and he is always willing to take on new challenges with a positive attitude. He has a great sense of self-awareness, and takes responsibility for his own growth as a person and as an engineer. He is consistently dependable and is always willing to lend a helping hand.
									<br/><br/>
									My favorite thing about Jerry is his kind and caring nature. He is respectful to all of his coworkers, and always has a big bright smile on his face. It just warms your heart when you are with the guy, and you can't just help but smile too in his presence. If you are looking for someone who follows through on commitments, brightens up the mood in the office, and affect others with optimism, Jerry is undoubtedly the guy.

									Jerry Ho is a sharp young developer who worked on my team at Springbot. He has a strong educational background in Computer Science from Emory University, and actually started with Springbot as an intern. He did such valuable work as an intern that we offered him full time employment in Ops when he graduated. When I was hiring for a position on my Dev team I chose to bring Jerry over from Ops rather than hiring any of our external applicants.
									<br/><br/>
									Jerry is enthusiastic, friendly, and has an infectiously positive attitude that makes him fun to work with. He has taken on some very difficult tasks relative to his seniority and has made good decisions about when to put his head down and grind through things vs. when to ask for help. When we've paired on some hard problems he has more than once seen a good solution sooner than me. He shows strong dedication to his commitments. I know I can count on him to get things done even if it means putting in extra time or study. I believe he will continue to develop into a stellar engineer and would be an asset to any development team.

									As a member of the DevOps team, Jerry proved to be a valuable asset to both the team and myself personally. He showed a strong initiative to help improve our product by getting his work done in a timely, organized manner. On many occasions we was expected to wear several hats including release management, bug fixes, and monitoring. He was driven to learn and grow as a developer and a team member. He worked very well with the DevOps team thanks to his strong communication skills.
									<br/><br/>
									I had the pleasure of watching Jerry grow from an intern to a full-fledged software engineer. He became a mentor for DevOps members to follow. As an added bonus, he has a phenomenal voice...seriously, you should hear him sing.
